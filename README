| INTO THE SHADOWS - README |
-----------------------------

| OVERVIEW |
------------

Into The Shadows is a game where you play as a wandering explorer whom
accidentally falls down a fissure leading to an underground network of caverns.
You must find your way out by figuring out the passageways which are riddled
with traps, monsters, and secrets long forgotten.  Many explorers and
unfortunate wanderers have succumbed to the darkness which inhabits the area.
You will need to use whatever you can to survive; weapons from felled unknowns,
light sources long since extinguished brought back to show you the way, as for
food, well you will have to make do with what is around.

Some enemies are sensitive to light in different ways, they can become
temporarily blind or even turn to stone while in certain light.  The longer you
go without light, the more you will adjust to the darkness, however, you will
not be able to see as well as the denizens which have evolved to not require as
much light to see.  Weapons scavanged from the environment will eventaually
break and you can only hold so much until you are weighed down to the point of
not being able to move beyond a slouching walk.  Be careful, as some weapons
make a lot of sound and produce a noticible light which can attract nearby
enemies.

The game takes place from a first person perspective, using dynamic lighting
only.  Platforms are still being decided, however, potential targets are; Pyra,
Pandora, Linux, Windows, Xbox 360, Xbox, OUYA, and BlackBerry 10.  Initially,
the game will target the Pandora.
